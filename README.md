# Swarm Intelligence: Ant Colony Optimization
### Netlogo simulation and results
(The project was undertaken to study one of the very interesting branchs of Swarm Intelligence: Ant colony optimization)

Ants, like many other social insects, perform very structured and complex tasks collectively without any central coordinating body in a self-organizing way. They do so by a simple yetrobustcommunicationmodelnamedstigmergy. Thetheoryof swarm intelligence has extended this robust biological insight into artificial systems. Implementation of ant colony optimization, one of the first types of swarm intelligence, has been proven to be very successful in solving hard combinatory problems in artificial systems and robotics. The ant colony’s selection of the optimal solution is dependent on various factors such as pheromone secretion rate, pheromone evaporation rate, population size, and many others. This study is focused on investigating the ant colony’s exploratory behavior in food searching and collection tasks by varying these parameters. It runs computer simulation on an agent-based modeling software and presents the ant colony with qualitatively different food sources at a different distance. The study finds that the evaporation rate has a substantial effect on the time taken to complete the food collection task regardless of the diffusion rate and the ant colony size, and the relationship among them is highly non-linear.
